# LinkFree Profile Page Generator

## What this is:
A PowerShell script that generates a simple, responsive HTML profile page with embedded social media links and profile picture. Perfect for creating a personal landing page or digital business card.

- üé® **Modern Design** - Clean, dark theme with hover effects and responsive layout
- üåç **International Phone Support** - Automatic formatting for 13+ countries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Profile picture file not found"**
- Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists
- Use absolute paths if relative paths aren't working

**"The term 'param' is not recognized"**
- Make sure you're running from PowerShell (not Command Prompt)
- Check your execution policy: `Get-ExecutionPolicy`
- Set execution policy if needed: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

**Script won't run**
- Ensure the file is saved with `.ps1` extension
- Try running with: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Generate-ProfilePage.ps1`
